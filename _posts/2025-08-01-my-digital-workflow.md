How I take, edit and store digital photos.

## Camera Settings

- I take photos in RAW
- Make sure the camera has the correct date and time

## Backup

[Amazon Photos](https://www.amazon.co.uk/photos) offers unlimited photo storage (including RAW files), as long as you
have Amazon Prime. I use it to back up every photo I take.

## Editing

I use [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) to edit and filter the RAW files.

I delete most of my photos at this stage, and only edit and export the ones I want to keep.

## Storage

I export my edited photos from Lightroom into [Apple Photos](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/photos/). Most photos just sit
on my camera roll, but I'll "favourite" some of them, and use albums if they're from a particular event or holiday.

## Getting Prints

If I want good old-fashioned 6x4 prints, I use [FreePrints](https://www.freeprintsapp.co.uk/) or
[SnapFish](https://www.snapfish.co.uk/).

For a big print to go on my wall, I use [Whitewall](https://www.whitewall.com/).
