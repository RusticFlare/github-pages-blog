excerpt: "If it brings you joy, don't be afraid to get two of them."

This is something I realised when I got a [Chilly's Water Bottle](https://www.chillys.com/collections/bottles-series-2): I wasn't washing it as regularly as I needed to.

I liked using it so much that I was taking it to the office and keeping it by my bed overnight. This meant I wasn't finding time to give it a wash and let it air out.

So, I bought another one.

This meant that I could wash one, while using the other.

There's a lot of things that you can apply this to: t-shirts, bedding, mugs... anything that you like to use daily and can be taken out of action for a bit.

If it brings you joy, don't be afraid to get two of them.
