Hi, I'm James! Welcome to my blog.

## Why have I started a blog?

For a while now, I've wanted to be more deliberate about how I spend time online. 

A few years ago I was using:
| _Social Media_ |   _Group Chats_    | _General Interest_ |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Facebook       | Facebook Messenger | YouTube            |
| Instagram      | WhatsApp           | Reddit             |

### The Problems With Social Media

Over time, using these apps started to feel _unpleasant_. Maybe you've felt that way as well?
They began to introduce features that I didn't want:

- Alcorithmic feeds
- Infinite scroll
- Sponsored content
- Suggested content

These featues exist for one reason: to keep you on the app as long as possible. All of the
apps above make their money from adverts. So the longer they can keep your attention, the
more adverts they can show you, the more money they make.

I don't want how I spend my time to be decided by an algotithm.

I don't want to be see adverts intermingled with my friends and families photos.

I don't want to have to keep scrolling, just in case the next thing I'm shown in intersting.

There has to be a better way!

About six years ago I deleted my Facebook account. Then, two years ago, I stopped posting to
Instagram and opened [an account on Vero](https://vero.co/rusticflare). I can't remember the
last time I browsed Reddit (I do still use it when searching for answers to questions).

### Group Chats: The New Social Media

About a year ago, I noticed something different start to happen in my group chats: people
started sharing posts from social media. 

Previously, I'd used group chats to organise meeting up with friends and family.
