A short list apps that I think are better than the mainstream alternatives.

## Browser: [Brave](https://brave.com/)

Brave is a browser with tracker and ad blocking built in. It'll also get rid of annoying cookie pop-ups.

There are a few features that I turn off in the settings (Rewards and Wallet). Some websites don't work properly
unless you turn off Brave's safety features (e.g. Ticketmaster).

It's free to use and available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.

There's also [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), a privacy focused alternative to Google Search.

## Messaging: [Signal](https://signal.org/)

Signal is a non-profit encrypted messaging app. Think WhatsApp, without the ties to Meta/Facebook.

WhatsApp collect data about you, your device, and your contacts. This is because they make money by using your data to
taget adverts at you.

Signal collects much less data about you (just your phone number), because they make money through donations.

It's free to use and is available on iOS and Android. _You can also use a desktop app, but you need a phone with Signal
installed to set it up._

## Audiobooks: [Libro.fm](https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm770249)

Libro.fm is an online audiobook retailer that shares their profits with your chosen local bookshop. I
support [The Portal Bookshop](https://the-portal-bookshop.square.site/), an LGBTQIA, sci-fi and fantasy bookshop here in
York.

I prefer Libro.fm to Audible for these reasons:

- It's cheaper (¬£7.99 (vs ¬£8.99) per month for one audiobook credit)
- They support local businesses
- You download your DRM-free audiobooks
- If you cancel, you keep all your unused credits to spend later

They have apps for iOS and Android, and you can listen on their website. But because you can download the audiobooks,
you can also play them wherever and however you want!

[This is my referral link](https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm770249). If you use it to sign up, I get a free
audiobook. Thank you üôè

## VPN: [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/)

Mullvad is a privacy focused VPN (Virtual Private Network). It allows you to avoid being tracked on the internet by
encrypting your network traffic and hiding your IP address from sites you visit.

You don't need to provide any personal data to sign up. And they support anonymous payment methods, like posting cash or
a [prepaid-card from Amazon](https://amzn.eu/d/7CB4uxc).

It costs ¬£4 (or ‚Ç¨5) a month for 5 devices, and it's available on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.
