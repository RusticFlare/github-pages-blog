Hi, I'm James! Welcome to my blog.

## Why have I started a blog?

For a while now, I've wanted to be more deliberate about how I spend time online. 

I don't think Facebook/Instagram/TicTok/X are healthy ways to spend time. If I'm posting on those 
platforms, then I'm part of the problem. Sites like that live and die by the network effect, so by 
taking myself out ofthe network, I give my friends and family one less reason to stay there as well.

Hence: a blog. I don't know what I'll post here yet, but that's part of the fun!
