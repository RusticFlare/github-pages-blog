What I do with a roll of film after I've finished taking pictures.

## Keeping Notes

Firstly, I use a notebook (like [this](https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/film-photographers-memo-book), but any notebook/app will do) to help me remember things as I'm shooting.

I keep track of these:

- What film is in my camera
- A quick description and the date of any photos

## Developing

I post my film off to a lab for them to develop and scan my film. I always ask for the highest quality JPEG files, and for the developed film to be posted back to me.

[Gulabi](https://www.gulabi.co.uk/) is my favourite lab at the moment.

## Editing

I use [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) to edit the JPEG files I get back from the lab.

1. Import all the photos from each roll of film into a Lightroom album
2. Edits:
    - Adjust the **White Balance**
    - Increase the **Sharpness**
    - Straighten
    - Any other edits e.g. **Exposure**, **Tone Curve**, **Colour Grading**

   An example (where the film wasn't designed for artificial light):

   |:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
   | ![Lab scan](/assets/images/lab-scan.jpg) | ![Lightroom export](/assets/images/lightroom-export.jpg) |
   
   [//]: # (@formatter:on)

3. I set the date for when I took each photo (my notebook helps)
4. Export all the images in the album for long term storage

## Digital Storage

I keep my digital images in [Apple Photos](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/photos/) in an album structure like this:

```
Film
├── 2024
│   ├── 1 - Portra 400 - Leica M6
│   ├── 2 - Ilford HP5+ - Leica M6
│   ├── ...
│   
└── 2025
    ├── 43 - Ultramax - Contax T3
    ├── 44 - Cinestill 400D - Leica M6
    ├── ...
```

The album names have the format `number - film - camera`, so `43 - Ultramax - Contax T3` is the forty-third roll, it's Ultramax film, and shot on a Contax T3.

## Physical Storage

When the lab posts my negatives back to me, I transfer them into a [folder for negatives](https://amzn.eu/d/5ACQKzQ)with [negative archive sleeves](https://amzn.eu/d/bJnWvNX).

_**Note:** Some labs send you 10 strips of 4, others 7 strips of 6. Make sure to buy the right [negative archive sleeves](https://amzn.eu/d/bJnWvNX)._

Each sleeve is labeled in the same way as the digital album (`number - film - camera`).

## Getting Prints

If I want good old-fashioned 6x4 prints, I use [FreePrints](https://www.freeprintsapp.co.uk/) or[SnapFish](https://www.snapfish.co.uk/).

For a big print to go on my wall, I use [Whitewall](https://www.whitewall.com/).
