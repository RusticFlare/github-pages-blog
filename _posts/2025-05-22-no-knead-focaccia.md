# Steps

## Dough

1. Add everything from the [Bread Mixture ingredients table](#bread-mixture) into a mixing bowl.
2. Using a wooden spoon: stir until it's all incorporated into a _shaggy mess_.
3. Drizzle the _shaggy mess_ with a dash of **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**.
4. Seal the bowl with clingfilm.
5. Place in the fridge for at least 18 hours.

## Rise

> Do this about 2.5 hours before you want to eat your bread.

1. Using your hands, coat a deep baking tray in **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**.
    - This is to stop the dough sticking to your hands and the tray.
2. Take the dough out of the fridge and transfer it into the tray.
3. Gently stretch the dough out into the tray.
4. Fold the dough in half and flip it over, so the seam is on the bottom.
5. Gently stretch the dough out into the tray again.
6. Cover the tray with a tea towel for 1.5-2 hours.

## Dress and Bake

1. Preheat your oven to 220°C.
2. The dough should now have spread out to cover the surface of the baking tray. Otherwise, gently ease it into the
   corners.
3. Drizzle **Extra Virgin Olive Oil** over the dough.
4. Using your fingers: create deep dimples across the entire surface of the dough.
5. Sprinkle or nestle your [toppings](#toppings) into the dimpled dough.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes.

## Cool and Eat

1. Take the bread out the oven when it has a nice golden-brown colour.
2. Take it out the tray and place on a cooling rack.
3. Sprinkle it with some flakey salt.
4. Leave to cool for 20-30 minutes before eating.
5. Enjoy!

# Storage and Reheating

- Store in an airtight container.
- You can toast the bread by placing chunks in an air-fryer for ~4 minutes.
